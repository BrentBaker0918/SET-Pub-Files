This document summarizes the core structural rules of the **Singularity-Expanse Theory (SET)** for nuclear architecture. These rules explain nuclear geometry, neutron buffering, shell emergence, and orbital projection using 5D standing wave curvature dynamics.

## 🌀 1. Baker’s Law — Resonant Frequency  
> **ν = mc² / h**  
Every nuclear particle projects a field in 4D space with frequency set by its rest mass. This is the base resonance that governs projection energy.

## 📏 2. Standing Wave Shell Rule  
> **λ = 2πr / n → r = nh / (2πmc)**  
Field shells can only exist at radii where an integer number of wave nodes can close the curvature loop.

---

## 📐 3. Field Projection Radius  
> **r = nh / (2π mₑ c α)**  
The electron field appears at this radius, derived from the electron's mass and the fine-structure constant. This gives SET's version of orbital radius.  

- For Hydrogen (n=1), this reproduces the Bohr radius (~52.9 pm).

## 🧩 4. g-Shape Ring Closure Rule  
Proton rings must form **geometric closures** that allow perfect standing wave symmetry.  
Allowed ring shapes:

| Protons | Shape    | Interior Angle | Stable?     |
|---------|----------|----------------|-------------|
| 2       | Line     | 180°           | ✅ Yes      |
| 3       | Triangle | 60°            | ✅ Yes      |
| 4       | Square   | 90°            | ✅ Yes      |
| 6       | Hexagon  | 120°           | ✅ Yes      |
| 5, 7+   | Odd N-gons | 108°, etc.  | ❌ Requires neutron buffering |

## 🧱 5. Neutron Buffering Rule  
Neutrons act as **structural stabilizers**, not charge carriers.  
They are inserted when:
- Proton ring symmetry cannot close with integer wave fit
- Shell transitions require stress damping
- Field curvature mismatch would otherwise collapse  

Typical buffering ratios:  
| Z Range     | N/Z Ratio |
|-------------|-----------|
| Z = 1–8     | ~1.0      |
| Z = 9–20    | ~1.2      |
| Z = 21–50   | ~1.3–1.5  |
| Z > 50      | ~1.5–1.6+ |

## 🌀 6. Shell Emergence Rule  
New shells emerge when the **total curvature** allows a higher-order standing wave closure:  
> **rₙ = nh / (2π mₑ c α)**

- **n = 1:** Hydrogen
- **n = 2:** Begins with Lithium (Z=3)
- **n = 3:** Sodium (Z=11) through Argon
- **n = 4+:** Starts with Potassium and Lanthanides

## ⚖️ 7. Degeneracy and Shell Overlap  
Shells (like 3d and 4s) may **overlap in space**. When that happens:
- Field degeneracy occurs
- Orbital reordering follows empirical patterns (e.g., Cr, Cu anomalies)

---

## 🔒 8. Stability Conditions  
Stable nuclei satisfy all:
- g-shape closure rules
- Neutron buffering needs
- Shell projection symmetry

This explains:
- Missing isotopes (e.g., no stable element with 43 protons)
- Magic numbers from geometric field closure
- Isotope decay and metastability

## 🧠 SET Summary: Nuclear Rules in Action  
SET models atoms not just by charge, but by **5D curvature projection**, ring topology, and symmetry-enforcing neutrons. These rules predict:
- Which isotopes are stable
- When new shells appear
- Why valence electrons form
- Why covalent radius compresses after projection
